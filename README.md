# MNISTforGPU
This repository consists of a simple Python program written for handwritten digit recognization on MNIST dataset. One program works with standard CPU. The other one has only minor changes and works with the Nvidia GPUs enabled with CUDA and cuDNN.

The repository was made for my course CS 259 at SJSU.
